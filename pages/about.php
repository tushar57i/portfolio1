          Hello! This is Tushar. I am a Front-end Developer, Designer and Wordpress Expert with more than 3-year experience in Web Design and Coding, and I'm constantly improving my skills. My code is always valid and semantic and written by using all new technologies (HTML5/CSS3). Also, I create responsive layouts (Media Queries), usually based on the Bootstrap platform.
          I created a lot of sites with different functions and tasks using  HTML5, CSS3(with Bootstrap) and CMS WordPress.
          I love working with Wordpress because it gives a lot of opportunities for developers and it is very easy to use for the customers.
          <br>
            I am engaged in customizing WordPress themes & plugins and creating beautiful website.
